          <strong>Air and Sea:</strong> Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small
          cruise ship
          that docks in Yellow
          Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
          propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
          island within the next few years.

          <strong>Ground Transportation:</strong> Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every
          day.
          Private buses
          serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local
          rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are
          required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding
          Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
